/**
 * Deterministic roster allocation.
 *
 * A direct port of the original Python scheduler, kept behaviour-identical:
 * given the same inputs it always produces the same roster, every constraint it
 * is given is actually enforced, and anything it cannot satisfy is reported as
 * an explicit note rather than quietly fudged.
 *
 * The algorithm is a greedy fill with a fairness ranking. Days are processed in
 * order; within a day, shifts are filled in the organisation's own shift order.
 * For each vacancy the eligible pool is ranked by
 *
 *   1. fewest shifts worked so far in this roster   (spread the load)
 *   2. longest since last worked                    (spread the days out)
 *   3. name                                         (a stable, arbitrary tiebreak)
 *
 * Greedy rather than an exhaustive search because rosters are small, the result
 * must be explainable to whoever reads it ("Alice got Saturday because she'd
 * worked the fewest shifts"), and a solver that silently reshuffles everything
 * on a one-person change is worse to live with than one that does the obvious
 * thing.
 *
 * Dates are handled throughout as "YYYY-MM-DD" strings converted to whole-day
 * integers in UTC. Doing arithmetic on local-time Date objects would shift days
 * across daylight-saving boundaries, which for a roster is a real bug.
