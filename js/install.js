/**
 * "Add to Home Screen" support.
 *
 * Rosterm8 is meant to live on a phone's home screen, where it opens full
 * screen and works offline - but that only happens if someone installs it, and
 * the browser's own prompt is easy to miss. This captures the install event so
 * Settings can offer a button instead.
 *
 * The two platforms differ:
 *  - Chrome (Android and desktop) fires `beforeinstallprompt`, which we hold on
 *    to and replay when the user asks.
 *  - iOS Safari has no such API at all. Nothing can trigger its Share sheet
 *    programmatically, so there the only honest thing to do is show the steps.
